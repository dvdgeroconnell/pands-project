This repository contains the files associated with the Programming and Scripting project, the subject of which is an analysis of Fisher's iris data set.

### Fisher's iris data set
"The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistical analysis. It was introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*.‚Äù See Ref [2].
The dataset contains 150 sets of measurements, consisting of 3 sets of 50 measurements across each of 3 species of iris flowers - setosa, versicolor and virginica. The measurements cover the sepal and petal length and width for each flower.

This summary was derived from various sources, notably [1], [2]
More information may be found in reference 4.

## Source
The raw dataset in useable csv format was downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv). The raw csv file has already undergone some cleanup, including the varieties being presented simply as setosa, versicolor and vigginica.
